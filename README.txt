To generate high-cross data and low-cross data, first run the files SynthticHighCrossDataGeneratorNoiseDimNumVary.R and SynthticLowCrossDataGeneratorNoiseDimNumVary.R, respectively. The created data is saved in the Data folder.

The Data folder also contains four real-world datasets.

Each folder, with the exception of the Data folder, is named by the algorithm. In each folder, Figure 3 and Figures 5-7 are obtained by running SyntheticData_ALGORITHMNAME.R. Table 3 and Figures 8-9 are obtained using SyntheticDataNoiseDimVary_ALGORITHMNAME_CV.R and SyntheticDataYaoNoiseDimVary_ALGORITHMNAME_CV.R. The results of Figure 11, Figure 13, and Tables 4-5 are obtained by running German_ALGORITHMNAME_CV.R, CreApp_ALGORITHMNAME_CV.R, Spam_ALGORITHMNAME_CV.R and SportsArt_ALGORITHMNAME_CV.R.
